<h2>In this release</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to answer "where is this element declared?", and "what is using this element?" and perform navigation.
</li>

    general problem with code completion being confused over location in grammar leading to code completion giving many 
    irrelevant proposals.

<li>Improved folding of comments.</li>
<li>Improved validation - additional stylistic and potential problems controlled via preferences.</li>
<li>A wizard that creates an empty Modulefile has been added.</li>
<li>Close to 80 issues fixed (enhancements and problems).</li>
<li>General stability improvments and enhanced base functionality as Geppetto is now based on
    Eclipse Indigo service release 2, and Xtext 2.2.1.
</li>
<li>Includes EGit 1.3 which adds support for submodules and additional improvments when working with git.
