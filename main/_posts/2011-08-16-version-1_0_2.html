title: geppetto 1.0.2 released
---
<p>The 1.0.2 release of Geppetto is available as an update from within Geppetto for
all users of 1.0.x.
Please see the <a href="/geppetto/faq.html">FAQ</a>
for information if you run into problems updating from 1.0.0). Checkout
<a href="/geppetto/faq.html#2011/06/28/how-do-i-update">how to update</a> if you don't know how.</p>

<h2>In this release</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Proposals for unknown references available as quick fixes (type 'gebud'
        and Geppetto will guess you meant 'debug').</li>
    <li>Supports turning 'todo' and 'fixme' in comments into tasks. The tags
        are not case sensitive. If a '!' is found (somewhere) after the tag, the
        created task will have high priority set in the task list. Task comment
        text is colored dark grey by default (configurable).
    </li>
    <li>Default platform is now puppet 2.7.</li>
    <li>File properties/parameters for SELinux are now recognized.</li>
    <li>Circular module dependencies now generate a warning instead of error.
    </li>
    <li>Calls to 'include' and 'require' now validate their arguments
        (if they are static),
        and any reference errors are reported.</li>
    <li>Validation of String Interpolation improved
        (small errors would cause wide consequences).</li>
    <li>Improvements in module import from forge, and module 
        metadata editing.
    </li>
</ul>
