<h2>In this release</h2>
<ul>
    <li>20Mb smaller footprint! and more functionality.</li>
    <li>Geppetto helps with the transition from dynamically scoped variables
    (supported by puppet <= 2.7), to the "local, inherited, and global"-only scopes
    support ed by 2.8. Geppetto does this by validating variable references for
    target >= puppet 2.7, and offering suggestions for fixes.
    <ul>
        <li>Geppetto supports best practice, i.e., to make all references to global 
        variables use the '::' namespace (i.e., use $::operatingsystem, in favor
        of $operatingsystem).</li>

        <li>Geppetto helps by flagging "unknown" variables, as well as "unknown and 
        unqualified". When targeting 2.7 these are flagged as errors, and when targeting
        the future 2.8, they are flagged as errors.</li>

        <li>Unfortunately, it is not possible for Geppetto to validate the existence
        of all global variables as a majority are not known until runtime.</li>

        <li>For target 2.6, Geppetto behaves as before (no warnings or errors as it 
        is impossible to statically verify the existence of dynamically scoped variables).</li>

        <li>For target >= 2.7, Geppetto requires that all non global qualified refer
        ences are to known variables and will issue warnings (2.7), or errors (2.8). As 
        a consequence Geppetto 2.1 knows about variables in the $settings:: namespace.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Fixes issues, and regressions in 2.0.1 validation.</li>
    <li>Support for Java (Eclipse JDT) removed from packaged product.</li>
    <li>Based on Eclipse Indigo SR1 which means a large number of fixed issues
    in base functionality, and git support.</li>
</ul>
