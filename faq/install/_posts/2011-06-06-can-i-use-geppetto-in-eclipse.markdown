If you want to install Geppetto into your Eclipse IDE, you can do so by giving the Eclipse
update manager this repository URL: `http://geppetto-updates.puppetlabs.com/4.x`.
Please note that this URL is for use by a download manager - it is not meaningful
to visit this URL with a browser.

Note that Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) or later is required.
