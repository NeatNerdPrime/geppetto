title: Geppetto reports that Java 1.6 is used but Java >= 1.7 is installed
---
Multiple Java versions may be installed on a machine but Geppetto will use the
one that is configured as default. You can determine which one that is by
issuing the command:

    $ java -version

If you're on a Mac, then [How do I make Java >= 1.7 the default on MacOS/X](/geppetto/faq.html#/2014/09/22/default-java-on-mac).
might provide more help.
